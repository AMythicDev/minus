//! `minus`: A library for asynchronous terminal [paging], written in Rust.
//!
//! If you want to learn about its motivation and features, please take a look into it's [README].
//!
//! # Overview
//! When getting started with minus, the two most important concepts to get familier with are:
//! * The [Pager] type: which acts as a bridge between your application and minus. It is used
//! to pass data and configure minus before and after starting the pager.
//! * Initialization functions: This includes the [dynamic_paging] and [page_all] functions which
//! take a [Pager] as argument. They are responsible for generating the initial state and starting
//! the pager.
//!
//! See the docs for the respective items to learn more on its usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Threads
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use minus::{dynamic_paging, MinusError, Pager};
//! use std::{
//!     fmt::Write,
//!     thread::{spawn, sleep},
//!     time::Duration
//! };
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), MinusError> {
//!     // Initialize the pager
//!     let mut pager = Pager::new();
//!     // Run the pager in a separate thread
//!     let pager2 = pager.clone();
//!     let pager_thread = spawn(move || dynamic_paging(pager2));
//!
//!     for i in 0..=100_u32 {
//!         writeln!(pager, "{}", i);
//!         sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
//!     }
//!     pager_thread.join().unwrap()?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## tokio
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use minus::{dynamic_paging, MinusError, Pager};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use std::fmt::Write;
//! use tokio::{join, task::spawn_blocking, time::sleep};
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), MinusError> {
//!     // Initialize the pager
//!     let mut pager = Pager::new();
//!     // Asynchronously send data to the pager
//!     let increment = async {
//!         let mut pager = pager.clone();
//!         for i in 0..=100_u32 {
//!             writeln!(pager, "{}", i);
//!             sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
//!         }
//!         Result::<_, MinusError>::Ok(())
//!     };
//!     // spawn_blocking(dynamic_paging(...)) creates a separate thread managed by the tokio
//!     // runtime and runs the async_paging inside it
//!     let pager = pager.clone();
//!     let (res1, res2) = join!(spawn_blocking(move || dynamic_paging(pager)), increment);
//!     // .unwrap() unwraps any error while creating the tokio task
//!     //  The ? mark unpacks any error that might have occurred while the
//!     // pager is running
//!     res1.unwrap()?;
//!     res2?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Static output
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::fmt::Write;
//! use minus::{MinusError, Pager, page_all};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), MinusError> {
//!     // Initialize a default static configuration
//!     let mut output = Pager::new();
//!     // Push numbers blockingly
//!     for i in 0..=30 {
//!         writeln!(output, "{}", i)?;
//!     }
//!     // Run the pager
//!     minus::page_all(output)?;
//!     // Return Ok result
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **Note:**
//! In static mode, `minus` doesn't start the pager and just prints the content if the current terminal size can
//! display all lines. You can of course change this behaviour.
//!
//! ## Default keybindings
//!
//! Here is the list of default key/mouse actions handled by `minus`.
//!
//! **A `[n] key` means that you can precede the key by an integer**.
//!
//! | Action              | Description                                                                  |

//! | /                   | Start forward search                                                         |

//! Currently these cannot be changed by applications but this may be supported in the future.
